        We believe that Africa has a lot to offer in terms of raw talent,
        however, the majority of the talent goes unnoticed. We have decided to
        solve this problem by creating The OUTLIER PLATFORM which has been
        designed to present detailed profiles of some of the most talented
        footballers emerging from Africa to recruiters all around the world at
        the click of a button.
        {/* <p className='sections-body__sub-paragraph'>
          Our goal is to create innovative solutions that will bridge this gap. Think of us as a Wyscout (an active archive) for emerging talent.
